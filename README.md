## Power Method for Finding Eigenvalue
This is a project for my Linear Algebra course, instructed by Dr. Salavati, Fall 2020.

In order to run this code, use one of the following commands based on the type of the matrix you want to give.

For using an input file existing in the same directory, use the following command. Remember to put matrix and other data exactly the same structure as in the *input.txt* file.
> python3 power_method.py --m input_file
>
>python3 power_method.py matrix input_file

For using a random and simple matrix without giving any matrix to the code, use:
> python3 power_method.py --m default
>
> python3 power_method.py matrix default

For inserting matrix data on terminal, use:
> python3 power_method.py --m input
>
> python3 power_method.py matrix input
